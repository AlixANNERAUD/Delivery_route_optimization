  abstract={Purpose Biogeography‐based optimization algorithm is a new kind of optimization algorithm based on biogeography. It is designed based on the migration strategy of animals to solve the problem of optimization. The purpose of this paper is to present a new algorithm – biogeography migration algorithm for traveling salesman problem (TSPBMA). A new special migration operator is designed for producing new solutions. Design/methodology/approach The paper gives the definition of TSP and models of TSPBMA; introduces the algorithm of TSPBMA in detail and gives the proof of convergence in theory; provides simulation results of TSPBMA compared with other optimization algorithms for TSP and presents some concluding remarks and suggestions for further work. Findings The TSPBMA is tested on some classical TSP problems. The comparison results with the other nature‐inspired optimization algorithms show that TSPBMA is useful for TSP combination optimization. Especially, the designed migration operator is very effective for TSP solving. Although the proposed TSPBMA is not better than ant colony algorithm in the respect of convergence speed and accuracy, it provides a new way for this kind of problem. Originality/value The migration operator is a new strategy for solving TSPs. It has never been used by any other evolutionary algorithm or swarm intelligence before TSPBMA.},

    abstract = {This article finds feasible solutions to the travelling salesman problem, obtaining the route with the shortest distance to visit n cities just once, returning to the starting city. The problem addressed is clustering the cities, then using the NEH heuristic, which provides an initial solution that is refined using a modification of the metaheuristic Multi-Restart Iterated Local Search MRSILS; finally, clusters are joined to end the route with the minimum distance to the travelling salesman problem. The contribution of this research is the use of the metaheuristic MRSILS, that in our knowledge had not been used to solve the travelling salesman problem using clusters. The main objective of this article is to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is more efficient than Genetic Algorithms when clusters are used. To demonstrate the above, both algorithms are compared with some cases taken from the literature, also a comparison with the best-known results is done. In addition, statistical studies are made in the same conditions to demonstrate this fact. Our method obtains better results in all the 10 cases compared.},

abstract = { In this paper, an effective multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is proposed to solve the multiple travelling salesman problem. In order to obtain minimum total visited distance and minimum range between all salesmen, some novel representation, crossover and mutation operators are designed to enhance the local and global search behaviours, then NSGA-II framework is applied to find well-convergent and well-diversity non-dominated solutions. The proposed algorithm is compared with several state-of-the-art approaches, and the comparison results show the proposed algorithm is effective and efficient to solve the multiple travelling salesman problems. }

  abstract={We propose a good solution to the traveling salesman problem (TSP) of N cities with fixed resource using a Multi-Agent System. Our strategy involves a partition of the cities into m groups and assign a single agent to search for the shortest path that covers all the cities in the assigned group using the best TSP solver available. Our method is practical as we cannot find the exact solution by exhaustive search when N is large but the computational resource is limited. The theoretical problem needed to solve is to optimize the number m* of agent that produces the smallest total cost, assuming that the hiring of additional agent incurs a fixed cost cs and a cost of time ct to covering all N cities. We find an optimal number m* that is a function of N, cs and ct, as well as the computational powered provided. This strategy in solving traveling salesman problem with finite computing resources is tested on a random point set pattern on the plane and a real case "nrw1379" in the TSPLIB library and the model TSP solver used is based on genetic algorithm.},
